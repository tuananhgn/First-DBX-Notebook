# TODO

Reproduce steps:

  1. Go to User Setting -> Linked accounts -> Set your Git provider and credentials
  2. Choose GitHub
  3. using Linked Account -> Configure -> Install Databrick, in this case I use personal repo instead of organisation
  4. Choose selected repo only (limited access)
  5. Create remote repo -> Clone -> Checkout branch locally
  6. Work on it -> Commit & push
  7. To GitHub web UI -> Create PR to get code review, approve and merge to master / main branch

Thought: 
Probably looking into setup CI / CD which kinda cool


TODO: 
1. Create a Databricks DLT that support end-to-end transformation
2. Setup CI CD but not sure where that would lead to
3. Implement Medallion Architecture for DWH
